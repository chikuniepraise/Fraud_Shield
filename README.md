# Fraud Shield Project

This repository has the code and materials for the Fraud Shield project, which aims to create a fraud detection and prevention system.


## Assumptions

In the process of developing this project, certain assumptions have been made to guide the design and implementation. 

These assumptions include:

1. **Data Source**: The project utilizes a sample dataset from Kaggle `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud`, which includes both legitimate and fraudulent activities.

2. **Data Store**: The project use Hadoop and Java was installed as it is a prerequiste.

3. **Machine Learning Approach**: The project assumes a machine learning-based approach for fraud detection, using supervised learning technique to identify anomalous patterns.

4. **Data Preprocessing**: Before the data was fed into the machine learning models, the data pretreatment pipeline included stages such as scaling, feature engineering, and data purification.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Model performance was evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 

6. **Deployment**: This project focuses on model development, and this is showcased on a website ` `

7. **Visualization**: Visualization was done using Tableau.
