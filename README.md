## Assumptions

In the process of developing this project, certain assumptions have been made to guide the design and implementation. 

These assumptions include:

1. **Data Source**: The project utilizes a sample dataset from Kaggle `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud`, which includes both legitimate and fraudulent activities.

2. **Data Store**: The project use Hadoop and Java was installed as it is a prerequiste.

3. **Machine Learning Approach**: The project assumes a machine learning-based approach for fraud detection, using supervised learning technique to identify anomalous patterns.

4. **Data Preprocessing**: Before the data was fed into the machine learning models, the data pretreatment pipeline included stages such as scaling, feature engineering, and data purification.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Model performance was evaluated using standard metrics like scikit learn, accuracy, precision, recall. 

6. **Deployment**: This project focuses on model development, it is showcased on a blog `https://frauddetectionbigdata.blogspot.com/2023/08/fraud-shield-against-credit-card-fraud.html?m=1 `

7. **Visualization**: Visualization was done using Tableau.
8. Scikit learn, Hadoop, Apache Spark, Impala was used for the analysis.
